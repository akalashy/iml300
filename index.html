          <h3>Project 1: Interactive Audio &amp; Visual with p5.js</h3>
          <p><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/asti/full/RwXoha-GD">The Scream</a></p>
<p class="project-desc">I was inspired by the artwork "The Scream" created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. It was the first idea that I thought of for working with sound. I searched for the sound I associated with this painting. To add a little fun/satire and visual interactivity, I attached another image like The Scream, but with a cat instead of the original figure. The user can click on the image and hear an actual scream as well as turn the screaming human into a screaming cat. </p>
<br />
          <h3>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MavQ28UJldZTUPddyrKSw3kivWw3LG38nBxZNYlQyI/edit?usp=sharing">Concept</a><br />
            <a href="https://akalashy.github.io/iml300/project-2/synesthesia.html">Synesthesia</a>
          </p>
<p class="project-desc">For my interactive non-linear narrative, I was inspired by the neurological condition Synesthesia, and more specifically, grapheme-color synesthesia, which is a perceptual phenomenon where individuals involuntarily associate specific colors with letters and numbers, and Chromesthesia, which is a form of synesthesia where sounds involuntarily trigger the perception of colors. The website allows users to learn about these conditions, experience seeing letters in different colors, hearing sounds, and seeing different textures with each letter.</p>
<br />
          <h3>Project 3: Networked Care</h3>
          <p><a href="https://akalashy.github.io/iml300/project-3/bwHome.html">BEYOND THE BLUE WHALE GAME</a></p>
          <p class="project-desc">Beyond the Blue Whale Game is an interactive website that examines the digital myths, manipulations, and social fears surrounding the Blue Whale challenge. While the moral panic around the challenge was often exaggerated, the vulnerability of young users in online spaces is real. This project explores how harmful narratives spread, how isolation and secrecy are used as tools of manipulation, and how digital environments can shape mental health and self-perception.
I created this website for teenagers, educators, parents, and anyone navigating the blurred space between online influence and personal safety. By combining research, media analysis, and interactive elements, the project aims to reveal how dangerous online behaviors are not caused by a “game,” but by systemic issues: lack of digital literacy, emotional isolation, and exploitative online dynamics.
This work responds to social justice issues by emphasizing youth protection, mental health awareness, and the importance of accessible digital education. Instead of sensationalizing fear, the project encourages critical thinking, informed choices, and safer online community practices. </p>

            <p class="vibe-note">The name of my website is MiniMuse, which is an online directory / digital museum with the greatest art pieces and information about them. It also allows users to draw on a board and leave wishes or drawings.

            <p class="vibe-note">I asked V0 to create a website about the band Depeche Mode. It consists of each album with the list of songs, a short biography about the band members, and a concert search bar for finding by month and year. The idea of choosing a band was inspired by reading the article “Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War” by Olia Lialina. The Webpage example about a favorite music group reminded me of Depeche Mode. There is also a short puzzle of words to guess a song name, which will help to choose a song to listen to when the user is not sure and just plays the puzzle for fun. The article mentioning the website requiring little interactivity from the user inspired me to make the song list for each album to open up not by clicking on them, but by hovering the mouse cursor over them. </p>

            <p><a href="https://swiss-design-haven.lovable.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #3</a></p>
            <p class="vibe-note">For my vibe-coding experiment, I was inspired by the article, “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” by Laurel Schwulst. I asked the AI “Lovable” to create a post about Swiss-style interior design. I asked to make it simple and clean, with each section being easy to navigate. The website includes a furniture section, to see the types of furniture potentially required, with the names of different stores, and recommendations for each type of item. There is another section for rooms and design details, as well as photographs mentioned under each one. And, there is a section for designers and information about their experience and specialization, so the potential client can connect with them after choosing who to work with. The user can fill out personal information such as full name, address, project type, and provide information about their preferences and vision to request a consultation according to their request.</p>

            <p><a href="https://stellar-canvas-worlds.lovable.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #4</a></p>
            <p class="vibe-note">For vibe coding exercise #4, inspired by the House Tour by MollySoda and the artist’s website, I asked Lovable to create a website looking like an online universe of “home” where the user, by clicking on each planet, will open a new world through its aesthetics and playlist. The songs can be played by clicking on them, and the images are photographs of planets and concerts.

            <p class="vibe-note">For this vibe coding experiment, I was inspired by the Glitch Studies Manifesto, where every break becomes a new aesthetic revelation. The “nomad of noise” and “acousmatic videoscape” ideas transform exploration into a performative act that merges sound and vision.
I asked V0 to create a website that allows users to type messages that mutate into unpredictable glitch poetry, letters flicker, words dissolve, and meaning reassembles itself. It is a digital environment where users encounter shifting “rooms” made of visual and textual glitches that respond unpredictably to their mouse movements. Each mouse movement or scroll creates distorted sounds, crackles, static, and broken audio snippets.
Users can click or drag to construct digital walls, arches, and stained-glass patterns made of glitch textures. After a few seconds, the architecture begins to collapse on its own, inspired by Menkman’s view that “the glitch has no solid form or state through time.” Each visit becomes temporary, a ritual that can never be repeated exactly. Users can “submit” a short phrase, image, or line of code as a digital prayer to noise. The system instantly corrupts and remixes it into a new artifact that becomes part of the Cathedral’s ever-changing structure.</p>

            <p class="vibe-note">I was inspired by Afro-now-ism by Stephanie Dinkins, especially the line  “Afro-now-ism is taking the leap and the risks to imagine and define oneself beyond systemic oppression—today.” I asked Claude to create a website that encourages users to practice Afro-now-ism as active resistance, focusing on self-defined progress instead of waiting for systemic change. The website is in a machinery style. The system produces a generative artwork or affirmation drawn from user input, prompting immediate, present-tense acts of creation, reflection, or care. For example, I wrote "I am creating a design," and it generated an affirmation: "My resistance is active. I am creating a design with precision and purpose."</p>

            <p class="vibe-note">I was inspired by the reading, "How to write non-violent creative code," the idea of the “honor the small”, which asks creators to de-emphasize growth and focus on context, care, and local meaning. I asked Claude to create a digital exhibition space where artists share small, low-bandwidth works that intentionally resist optimization, virality, or scaling. It challenges the obsession with growth and visibility online, showing that meaningful impact can come from intimacy and specificity. The website is minimalistic and contains examples of small works posted.</p>

            <p class="vibe-note">For the vibe coding experiment, I was inspired by the Curb Cuts. I asked Claude to create a website that shows 2 versions of the same world: one inaccessible, the other one redesigned through activism. As the cursor moves across, walls turn into ramps and “No Access” signs turn into open doors. 
The opposition between restriction and liberation inspired a split-screen metaphor, where users move between exclusion and access. The transformation of walls into ramps symbolizes both physical and social progress.</p>

            <p><a href="https://v0-algorithmic-unraveling-website.vercel.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #9</a></p>
            <p class="vibe-note">For this vibe coding experiment, I was inspired by Cyberfeminism Index by Mindy Seu and the critique of hidden digital infrastructures, especially the way algorithms silently sort people through biased, patriarchal, and colonial assumptions. I asked the V0 to create a website that turns this critique into a simple interactive tool. The user can enter a small piece of personal data, and the system tries to categorize them, showing how quickly algorithms jump to conclusions. 
The user can push back using anti-classification tools that glitch, distort, or confuse the algorithm. As they resist, the system’s confidence breaks down, eventually generating a decolonized profile that refuses fixed labels. </p>

            <p><a href="https://chaos-chorus-canvas.lovable.app/">Vibe Coding Experiment #10</a></p>
            <p class="vibe-note">For this Vibe Coding Experiment, I was inspired by Olivia Jack’s Hydra video synth, the use of feedback loops, shared signals, and collaborative visual chaining, where multiple sources merge into one constantly evolving image. I asked Lovable to create a platform where each user’s webcam is turned into a visual oscillator. 
Users can modulate their video with sliders (noise, echo, ripple, tint). Each user affects the global collage. There is also a sync mode, where all participants must agree to reset the visuals at the same time, creating a moment of collective coordination before the chaos begins again.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Reflections on my Experience with Vibe Coding</h2>
        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            Vibe coding experiments are a way of brainstorming and exploring ideas. At the beginning of using the Claude.ai, V0.app, and Lovable.dev, I noticed that these AI programs did not generate the websites I expected. Over time, I learned that writing a more detailed and intentional prompt could lead to results that were surprisingly creative. With each new topic and ideation process, my creative coding practice has improved. Vibe coding still has limitations, especially because the AI does not fully understand certain nuances and visual intentions. It is not intuitive enough. However, it helps reveal other possible outcomes I may not have considered, and it becomes part of the creative process. The aesthetics produced through vibe coding are rarely strong enough on their own, yet with a clear request, the AI can generate unique and interesting outcomes. The technology still needs to evolve to respond with a more intuitive, aesthetically interesting UI, and without too much formality in the design. The vibe-coding experiments proved that these programs are capable of much more, and they should be explored.
