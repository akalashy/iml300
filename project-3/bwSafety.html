        <h1>Staying Safe Online</h1>
        <p>
          Safety is not about “being strong enough” to ignore harm. It is about having tools,
          support, and language to protect yourself and others when something feels wrong in
          a chat, group, or game.

          <h2>Trust Your Unease</h2>
          <p>
            If a message makes you feel scared, guilty, pressured, or confused, that feeling
            matters. You do not need proof that someone is “bad” in order to step back, block,
            or ask for help. Discomfort is already information.

        <article class="safety-card">
          <h2>Keep Your Circle</h2>
          <p>
            Staying connected to friends, family, counselors, or other trusted people is one of
            the strongest protections against manipulation. Anyone who demands total secrecy
            or tries to cut you off from others is not safe.

        <article class="safety-card">
          <h2>Pause Before Responding</h2>
          <p>
            You are allowed to take time. You can close the app, mute notifications, or say,
            “I need a break.” Urgency and “answer now or else” messages are often used to push
            past your boundaries.

        <article class="safety-card">
          <h2>Save Evidence</h2>
          <p>
            Screenshots and message logs can help if you decide to report someone or talk to a
            trusted adult or support service. Keeping records is not “dramatic”; it is a form of
            self-protection and documentation.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="safety-card">
          <h2>Block & Report</h2>
          <p>
            Using block, mute, and report tools is a valid response to harm. Platforms have a
            responsibility to act, and you are never obligated to keep engaging with someone
            who is making you feel unsafe or trapped.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="safety-card">
          <h2>You Deserve Support</h2>
          <p>
            Reaching out for help is not a failure; it is a form of resistance. Whether it is a
            friend, teacher, family member, or helpline, you deserve to be taken seriously when
            something online is hurting you or someone you care about.
