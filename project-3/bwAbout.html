        <h1>About This Project</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>Beyond the Blue Whale Game</strong> is an interactive website that examines the
          digital myths, manipulations, and social fears surrounding the Blue Whale challenge.
          While the moral panic around the challenge was often exaggerated, the vulnerability of
          young users in online spaces is real. This project explores how harmful narratives
          spread, how isolation and secrecy are used as tools of manipulation, and how digital
          environments can shape mental health and self-perception.
        </p>

        <p>
          I created this website for teenagers, educators, parents, and anyone navigating the
          blurred space between online influence and personal safety. By combining research,
          media analysis, and interactive elements, the project aims to reveal how dangerous
          online behaviors are not caused by a “game,” but by systemic issues: lack of digital
          literacy, emotional isolation, and exploitative online dynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
          This work responds to social justice issues by emphasizing youth protection, mental
          health awareness, and the importance of accessible digital education. Instead of
          sensationalizing fear, the project encourages critical thinking, informed choices, and
          safer online community practices.
