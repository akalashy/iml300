        <h2>Blue Whale Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Whale Challenge (Russian: Си́ний ки́т, romanized: Siniy kit), also known simply
          as the Blue Whale, is a social network phenomenon, first appeared in Russia in 2013,
          that is claimed to exist in several countries. It is a "game" reportedly consisting of a series
          of tasks assigned to players by administrators over a 50-day period, initially innocuous
          before introducing elements of self-harm and the final challenge requiring the player to
          commit suicide.

        <h2>Social Concerns</h2>
        <p>
          While many experts suggest "Blue Whale" was originally a sensationalised hoax, they
          believe that it is likely that the phenomenon has led to instances of imitative self-harming
          and copycat groups, leaving vulnerable children at risk of cyberbullying and online
          shaming. By late 2017, reported participation in Blue Whale was receding. Internet safety
          organisations across the world have reacted by giving general advice to parents and
          educators on suicide prevention, mental health awareness, and online safety in advance
          of the next incarnation of cyberbullying. “People join narratives to explain their
          experiences ... that is possibly why some children have said they participated in the
          rumoured challenge despite there being no proof of its existence.”

        <h2>Arrests</h2>
        <p>
          In 2016, Philipp Budeikin, a 21-year-old former psychology student who was expelled
          from his university, claimed that he invented the game in 2013. According to Budeikin,
          its purpose is to "clean society of biological wastes", as he intended to "clean" society
          from individuals who were deemed as having no value and considered as burdens.
          Although originally claiming innocence and stating he was "just having fun", Budeikin
          was arrested and held in Kresty Prison, Saint Petersburg, and in May 2016 pled guilty to
          "inciting at least 16 teenage girls to commit suicide". He was later convicted on two
          counts of inciting suicide of a minor. Commentators such as Benjamin Radford have
          pointed out that sensationalized stories in world news regarding the involvement of
          Budeikin have all linked back to just two Russian sources, with tabloid news outlets
          replicating the same information without elaboration.

        <h2>Alleged Incidents</h2>
        <p>
          Various countries have reported alleged connections between the Blue Whale narrative
          and cases of self-harm or suicide, often without clear evidence linking them directly to
          the “game”. In many places, authorities and media later acknowledged that coverage
          contributed to a moral panic, spreading fear more than verified facts. At the same time,
          the conversation highlighted real issues around youth mental health, online manipulation,
          and the responsibilities of platforms, governments, schools, and families in creating
          safer digital environments.
