    <h1>SYNESTHESIA</h1>
 <p id="p1">
          Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon where one sense is involuntarily experienced through another, such as seeing colors when hearing music or tasting words. It is not a disease, but a condition that causes a blending of senses, leading to experiences like seeing specific colors for letters (grapheme-color synesthesia), tasting food when hearing words (lexical-gustatory synesthesia), or feeling a physical touch when seeing it happen to someone else (mirror-touch synesthesia). Synesthesia is involuntary, consistent over time, and can be linked to enhanced memory and creativity.
